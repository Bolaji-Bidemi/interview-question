Task: Create a web application that fetches data from an API and displays it in a table. The application should also allow the user to search and filter the data.

Requirements:

    The application should be built using ReactJS and Redux.
    The API endpoint to fetch data from is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users. Fetch the data when the application loads.
    Display the data in a table with the following columns: Name, Username, Email, Phone, and Website.
    The table should have pagination that allows the user to navigate through the data.
    The user should be able to search for data by entering a search term in an input field. The search should be performed on the Name and Username columns only.
    The user should be able to filter the data by selecting a value from a dropdown list. The dropdown list should have the following options: All, Male, and Female. Filtering should be performed on the Gender column.
    The user should be able to clear the search term and filter by clicking on a "Clear" button.
    The application should have a clean and responsive design.

Bonus:

    Implement client-side sorting of the table data.
    Implement server-side pagination and sorting.
    Add tests for your components and reducers.

Notes:
    You can use any UI library or CSS framework you like, or write your own styles.
    You don't need to use any specific libraries for search or filtering, but you should be able to explain how your implementation works.
    You can use any testing framework you like, or write your own tests.

Submission

Please submit your code as a GitHub repository with a README file explaining how to run your tests.
Good luck!
